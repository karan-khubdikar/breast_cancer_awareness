## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
age_data <- read.csv("../data/filtered/age_data.csv") 

type_data <- read_csv("../data/filtered/canc_type_data.csv")
type_data

filtered_data2 <- type_data %>%
      filter(GEO == "Alberta") %>%
      mutate(VALUE = round(Percentage, 2))

    # Create pie chart
pie(filtered_data2$Percentage, 
    labels = filtered_data2$Cancer_type, 
    main = "Distribution of Cancer Types")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
